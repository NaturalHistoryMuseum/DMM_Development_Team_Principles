# Digital Media & Marketing Development Team Principles

## Introduction

The Development team in the Digital Media & Marketing department currently consists of 6 people working across 3 product groups: Growth, Visit and Commercial. Each product group is a cross-disciplinary team and we work on different projects and platforms but there are common themes that span across our work. We recently spent some time discussing and brainstorming these in our team meetings, broadly focussing on:

* how we make things (and how we want to make things)
* how we function as a dev team (and how we want to function as a dev team)
* what we want to achieve through our work for the Museum

We then talked about how we can map our thoughts back to the core values of the Natural History Museum: Expert, Relevant, Inspiring and Accessible. The below is what the team came up with!

### Expert
Be seen as a trusted voice of authority in the design and development of our digital world, and add value to the lives and  experiences of others through our work
-	Be involved in the design process to drive meaningful yet realistic user journeys
-	Work to a consistent set of standards to ensure parity across our codebase.  For example, tests should be written and task runners such as Gulp or Grunt should be used
- All code should be set up for testing and accessibility
- Every code repo should have a READEME.md, which includes a set up guide. New platforms or systems should have an associated environment guide.
-	Regular pair programming, code reviews, and opportunities to share knowledge, for example through dev meetings, hack days, meetups, presentations and blog posts
-	Time set aside for learning and development, and training
- Agile and flexible methodologies should be undertaken, with a main focus on the product

### Relevant
Strike a balance between maintaining and building on our existing assets, and innovating and experimenting with new technology.
-	Refactoring existing code
-	Automation of testing and developer processes
-	Spending 10% of our time on new app or tech to support product discovery and self learning
-	Creating a structure to allow our moonshot suggestions to be heard enabling empowerment
- Quality over quantity

### Inspiring
Help create interactions which inspire our colleagues to create the best possible content to champion our institution, and inspire change in the way people think about the natural world through out digital products.
-	Working with NHM Studios
-	Creating AR / VR interactives
-	Streamlining and improving backend systems to ease content creation
- We should take pride and passion in our work
- As developers, we should feel comfortable in not knowing if something is achievable with a particular tech stack and should feel excited to find out
- As developers, we should exchange ideas regularly (within and outside of our team), and should actively share our findings and work with others, as well as encouraging them to join in

### Accessible
Ensure all our work is as accessible as possible to all audiences.
-	Develop all content with accessibility in mind
-	Create a device test lab
-	Incorporate expert accessibility resources to structure our content.
- To be open and accessible, code should be on Github and, where possible, API's should be open
- Accessible products means performant products
- Accessible products means secure products


### To achieve our goals:
-	Time (for refactoring, testing, and training)
-	Resources such as devices, or additional staff (contractor and permanent)
-	Developed skillsets, both in existing and in new technologies
-	Clear lines of communication through management and design
