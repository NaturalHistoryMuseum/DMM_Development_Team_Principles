# Development Team Principles

## DDV Development Team Goals and Values

### Expert
Be seen as a trusted voice of authority in the design and development of our digital world, and add value to the lives and  experiences of others through work.  
-	Be involved in the design process to drive meaningful yet realistic user journeys
-	Work to a consistent set of standards to ensure parity across our codebase.  For example, tests should be written and task runners such as Gulp or Grunt should be used
- All code should be set up for testing and accessibility
- Every code repo should have a READEME.md, which includes a set up guide
-	Regular pair programming, code reviews, and opportunities to share knowledge, for example through dev meetings, hack days, meetups, presentations and blog posts
-	Time set aside for learning and development, and training
- Agile and flexible methodologies should be undertaken, with a main focus on the product

### Relevant
Strike a balance between maintaining and building on our existing assets, and innovating and experimenting with new technology.
-	Refactoring existing code
-	Automation of testing and developer processes
-	Spending 10% of our time on new app or tech to support product discovery and self learning
-	Creating a structure to allow our moonshot suggestions to be heard enabling empowerment
- Quality over quantity

### Inspiring
Help create interactions which inspire our colleagues to create the best possible content to champion our institution, and inspire change in the way people think about the natural world through out digital products.
-	Working with NHM Studios
-	Creating AR / VR interactives
-	Streamlining and improving backend interactions to ease content creation
- Pride and passion should be taken in our work
- Developers should feel comfortable in not knowing if something is achievable with a particular tech stack or not and they should feel excited to find out
- The exchange of ideas amongst developers should take place regularly, and developers should be happy to share their findings and work with others as well as encouraging them to join in

### Accessible
Ensure all our work is as accessible as possible to all audiences.
-	Develop all content with accessibility in mind
-	Create a device test lab
-	Incorporate expert accessibility resources to structure our content.
- To be open and accessible code should be on Github and API's should be open, open access allows performance to be reviewed by eeveryone and security must be good for peace of mind  


### To achieve our goals:
-	Time (for refactoring, testing, and training)
-	Resources such as devices, or additional staff (contractor and permanent)
-	Developed skillsets, both in existing and in new technologies
-	Clear lines of communication through management and design
